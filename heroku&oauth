declare version for Heroku to use
Heroku runs old versions of Node and npm so must declare

OAuth:

1. when a user clicks our login button, they are going to be directed to our server (localhost:5000 or wv/auth/google

2. server then forwards request to google servers

3. User grants permission to application

4. kicked back to server at server route (localhost:5000 or wv)/auth/google/callback

5. passport strategy saw the code inside url and automatically did a follow up request to google to exchange the code with the users actual profile and email address (whatever you have in scope)

6. After request is made a callback function is executed with the tokens and information and now we have the ability to add a new user

		a. Access Token - a token that allows us to do something on the users behalf (like post for the user or read profile, or add/delete emails inside of their inbox). Access token proves we are allowed to do that

		b. Refresh Token - allows us to refresh the access token. The access token automatically expires after some amount of time and we can be given optionally a refresh token that allows us to automatically update the access token (reach into the users account for additional amount of time)

		c. Profile - has all of our identifiying information (name, email, address, etc...)
