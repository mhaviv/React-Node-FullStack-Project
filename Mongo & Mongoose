Mongo DB is schemaless 

inside of every collection (table in postgres) every record could have its own very distinct set of properties

Mongoose is like Sequelize for sql

Model Class - used to access an entire collection in MongoDB

Model Intances - Javascript objects that represent a single record sitting inside of a collection
